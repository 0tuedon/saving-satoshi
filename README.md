# Saving Satoshi

We made an intro video for you:

[Saving Satoshi Pitch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX6oqDKzVx4)

Watched it? Awesome, let's continue...

A cypherpunk travels back in time to discover clues about Satoshi’s disappearance encountering Satoshi imposters, social attacks, and totalitarians that don’t want bitcoin to survive.

Saving Satoshi is an engaging first point of contact for devs of all ages learning about bitcoin development.

Learners will complete test-driven, repl-based lessons by completing missions traveling through bitcoin history.

Beginners can breeze through the basics while more advanced learners can dive into the harder challenges and easter eggs. In the future, pay for lesson completion or pass on real work in the form of challenges for pay Ender’s game style.

## Contributing

To contribute to the project, use issues and discussions in this GitHub repo (`saving-satoshi/saving-satoshi`), or join our Slack channel in the Bitcoin Design Community here:

Generally, we have four tracks in this project:

- Story
- Lessons
- Design
- Code

The more these are in tune with each other, the better the final user experience. We are currently still in a phase where we try to bring everything together in a coherent and interesting storyline.

The design for this project is handled in [this Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/LqjK3Tpvd9KJ4buFArCJBQ/Saving-Satoshi?node-id=0%3A1&t=HMELTIqCz6Nh68LI-1).

Images are generated via AI tools (mostly [DiffusionBee](https://diffusionbee.com)). The prompts consist of two parts, the scene description and the stylistic direction. The latter was `illustration concept art anime key visual trending, by victo ngai, by makoto shinkai, by takashi takeuchi, by studio ghibli`. You're welcome to contribute more images. We're still fleshing this process out a bit further.

## Local development setup

To run this project locally:

1. First download the code from this repository
2. Ensure you have the npm version 16.13.0 or higher installed
2. Run `npm install` to download the required code libraries
3. Run `npm run start` to spin up the development environment
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the site

## Roadmap

This project was started during the [Bitcoin Designathon](http://event.bitcoin.design) in October 2022. It then continued with the [bolt.fun Legends of Lightning Tournament](https://makers.bolt.fun/project/saving-satoshi).

Our first goal is to launch a V1 that provides a great basic experience around 2 chapters with lessons. Then we'd like to get feedback from the community to ensure that we are building something that resonates. Ideally, we'd then like to make necessary adjustments and open up contributions to everyone. 

Some ideas we have for the future

- Build out 10 chapter lessons
- Extract lessons into their own repository for independent editing
- Authentication using private keys
- Real-time collaboration with other players via public keys
- Built in REPLs (possibly with repl.it)
- Collaborative challenges
- More advanced lessons for learners looking to go deeper
- Localization to other languages if there is interest

Thank you so much for your interest in the project. We'd love to hear your feedback.
