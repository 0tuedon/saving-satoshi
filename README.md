We made an intro video for you:

Watched it? Awesome, let's continue...

## The mystery

The year is 2139. The very last bitcoin is slated to be mined in two weeks. For months, a final countdown has been taking place in Satoshi Square for the last block when there will officially be no more bitcoin issued.

And then suddenly, the network goes offline. Payments worldwide stop.

In the midst of the crisis, someone senses an opportunity. The mysterious and world-renowned computer scientist Dr. B.S. Wrong steps into the spotlight. He claims that, lo and behold, he's been Satoshi Nakamoto all along, and until further notice, the 21 million cap has been lifted, and the network will issue 1 million bitcoin every day indefinitely.

There is a knock at your door, and when you open it, a yellowed age-weathered envelope has been left for you. Inside, you discover the first clue of the most important mission of your life. 

And so begins your journey to save Satoshiâ€¦

Project's roadmap and next steps
We are looking to launch a V1 of the experience that includes 2 chapters by the end of the year.

## Below is a sample of things on the roadmap:

- [ ] Develop the front-end further
- [ ] Extract the lessons and put them into their own repository so that we can edit the content independently from the platform.
- [ ] Authentication using private keys
- [ ] Real-time collaboration with other players via public keys
- [ ] Built in REPLs (possibly with repl.it)
- [ ] Collaborative challenges
- [ ] More advanced lessons for learners looking to go deeper
- [ ] Generate updated imagery via AI art tools once the storyline has been refined further
- [ ] User testing and feedback gathering to refine the experience


Thank you so much for your interest in our project. If we put our heads together, maybe we stand a chance to defeat Dr. B.S. Wrong and save Satoshi.

To be continued...
