            The year is 2139. The very last bitcoin is slated to be mined in two
            weeks. For months, a final countdown has been taking place in
            Satoshi Square for the last block when there will officially be no
            more bitcoin issued.

          <p className="text-xl text-justify pt-4 pb-20">
            And then suddenly, the network comes to a crawl. Instead of the normal
            ten-minute block interval, blocks are coming in just a few times a day,
            if not longer. Your mom's bitcoin node stops syncing. The media starts
            reporting on the situation. It's everywhere on social media.
            <br />
            <br />
            The price of bitcoin is falling. There is a knock at your door, and when
            you open it, a yellowed, age-weathered envelope has been left for you.
            There's no name or return address. What could be inside?

            Bitcoin is serious, but this game is designed to be fun. Saving
            Satoshi is a light-hearted first point of contact for developers of
            all ages curious about bitcoin development. Saving Satoshi has a mix
            of technical text and code-based challenges, but the challenges
            should be doable for anyone with basic coding skills.
