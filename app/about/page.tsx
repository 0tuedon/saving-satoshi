            The year is 2139. The very last bitcoin is slated to be mined in two
            weeks. For months, a final countdown has been taking place in
            Satoshi Square for the last block when there will officially be no
            more bitcoin issued.

            And then suddenly, the network goes offline. Payments worldwide
            stop. In the midst of the crisis, someone senses an opportunity. The
            mysterious and world-renowned computer scientist Dr. B.S. Wrong
            steps into the spotlight. He claims that, lo and behold, he's been
            Satoshi Nakamoto all along, and until further notice, the 21 million
            cap has been lifted, and the network will issue 1 million bitcoin
            every day indefinately.
